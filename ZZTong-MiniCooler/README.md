# ZZTong-MiniCooler

This is an example modlet that adds the new cntMiniBeverageCooler to the list
of blocks available to the Appliances block. It does not, however, fix the
behavior of the Mini Beverage Cooler, so you'll have placement issues and the
inventory feature will go away once you empty it. (So don't empty it.)
