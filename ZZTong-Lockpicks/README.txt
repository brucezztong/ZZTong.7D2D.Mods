This changes the number of lockpicks crafted to be 5 times greater than vanilla.
Vanilla  : 1 Iron + 1 Mech Parts = 1 Lockpick
Modified : 1 Iron + 1 Mech Parts = 5 Lockpicks

This new ratio applies to the Lockpick Bundle too.
Vanilla  : 40 Iron + 40 Mech Parts = 40 Lockpicks
Modified :  8 Iron +  8 Mech Parts = 40 Lockpicks

This was done because the Vanilla cost to open loot chests is too high, plus
real lockpicks don't require this amount of resources. Carrying the damn things
around is enough of a challenge.

Please just open the damn chest.
