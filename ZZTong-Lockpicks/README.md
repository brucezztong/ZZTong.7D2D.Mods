*Lockpicks*

This changes the number of lockpicks crafted to be 5 times greater than vanilla.

Vanilla  : 1 Iron + 1 Mech Parts = 1 Lockpick
Modified : 1 Iron + 1 Mech Parts = 5 Lockpicks

This new ratio applies to the Lockpick Bundle too.

Vanilla  : 40 Iron + 40 Mech Parts = 40 Lockpicks
Modified :  8 Iron +  8 Mech Parts = 40 Lockpicks

This was done because the Vanilla cost to open loot chests is too high, plus
real lockpicks don't require this amount of resources. Carrying the damn things
around is enough of a challenge.

The Lockpick break chance it too high. I've never broken a lockpick in real
life. I've seen a student come close to breaking a pick.

A Vanilla pick will break 50% of the time, or 40%, 30%, and 20% with Perks.
This changes that to 20%, 10%, and 0% with Perks.

In real life it is more about having the right kind of tool and the knowledge
to use them. Then experience makes you faster. Picking a real lock is only
fast for a person with a lot of experience and who is using the right tools.
I think the game would be better if you assembled a kit of different kinds of
tools to use and forget the breaking of those tools.
