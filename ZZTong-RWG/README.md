# ZZTong-RWG

This changes the structure of RWG settlements. The nature of this modlet
changes from game version to game version depending on what is supported.

- Makes the oldwest town a little bigger. For a large world you may find the
western town starts to repeat POIs, but you will get a town with more Tiles.
This is a trade-off. There aren't a lot of Western POIs.

- Limits each trader to just 1 per map. This just suits my tastes. I don't like
to see the same trader in multiple locations. This will mean players have to
travel more, which I like but many do not.

- Includes commented-out XML that changes the outskirts wrapping district for CountryTown, Town, and City.
This is an active area of change for TFP and I don't feel like fighting it right now.

**UI Change**

The modlet provides more worldsize options in the Advanced RWG Menu. You should
be careful with this as V1.0's RWG is undergoing changes by TFP to be able to
support their story and to include new features. You may find that really small
and really large maps have unintended consequences.
