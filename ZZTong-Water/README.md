# ZZTong-Water

This modlet attempts to fix up the Vanilla water system so that survivalist
can carry water away from water sources. You no longer drink directly from
lakes and rivers. Instead you get a jar of murky water which you could drink.
You have to wait six seconds between jars being retrieved.

Murky Water now only stacks to 10, like other forms of water.

Boiled Water now has a 5% chance of dysentery. This represents that the process
of boiling water is not a perfect method for making potable water.

Changes Pure Mineral Water so that it can only be crafted at a Chemistry
Station, rather than at a Campfire, and this represents truly potable water.

This modlet arguably makes the first couple of days of survival easier as you're
not tied to raiding POIs to get jars of murky water. My goal was to continue
to have risk from boiled water as a way of lengthening the water struggle, trying
to keep a game-play, management element present, but also allow a human being to
carry water away from a source like humanity had done since before recorded history.
