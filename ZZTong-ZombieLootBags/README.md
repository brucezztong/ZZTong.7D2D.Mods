# ZZTong-ZombieLootBags

Loot bags disappear too quickly if you're playing a longer horde night. Plus, if
you fight hordes while mobile, it can take a while to find all of the loot bags.

- Dropped loot containers last 5 minutes (300 seconds).
- Yellow loot bags last 1 hour (3,600 seconds).
- Blue loot bags last 1 hour (3,600 seconds).
- Red loot bags last 1 hour (3,600 seconds).

This may not be a good modlet for multiplayer servers.
