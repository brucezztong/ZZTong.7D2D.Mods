# ZZTong-Farming

This reimplements A19 Farming, which was a more convenient form of farming that
produced roughly the same results as A20+ Farming without the time-consuming
effort to replant.

The original credit for this modlet goes to DRALEJANDRO. It only bears my name
because I like to maintain my own local versions of modlets. In this case, the
original modlet wasn't updated to A21. You should subscribe to DRALEJANDRO's
version of the modlet.
