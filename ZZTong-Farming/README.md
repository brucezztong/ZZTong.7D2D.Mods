# ZZTong-Farming

This reimplements A19 Farming, which was a more convenient form of farming that
produced roughly the same results as A20+ Farming without the time-consuming
effort to replant.

The original credit for this modlet goes to DRALEJANDRO. It only bears my name
because I like to maintain my own local versions of modlets in case they were
to disappear or lapse into an unmaintained state. In this case, the original
modlet wasn't updated to A21. I've not looked for a V1.0 version. You should
subscribe to DRALEJANDRO's version of the modlet if they have brought it up to date.
