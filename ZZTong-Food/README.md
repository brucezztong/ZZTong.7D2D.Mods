# ZZTong-Food

This modlet really just satisfies my tastes, so to speak, related to cooking conveniences.
I changed the recipe for Boiled Eggs because nobody really boils eggs individually, so this
lets you boil six eggs with one unit of water.

I also don't like being unable to can food. My mother does it, though I admit she doesn't
do it over a campfire. Then again, she doesn't make Blueberry Pie over a campfire either.

The additional Grandpa's Learning Elixir recipe is mostly because for solo play I think
the elixir could be more common and because Cat Food had no other use.

* Boiled Eggs now convert 6 Eggs and 1 Water into 6 Boiled Eggs
