# ZZTong-Animals

The goal of this modlet is to make hunting a bit more challenging as deer become more durable and
more elusive. This mostly affects the early game and is best for players who want it to be a little
harder at the start of the game. Specifically:

- Stags
    - Changes the sight range for Stags from 30 to 60.
    - Changes the panic move speed from 1.6 to 2.0.
    - Changes the health max from 50 to 350.
    - Changes the butcher harvest (raw meat) from 20 to 35.

- Does
    - Changes the sight range for Stags from 30 to 60.
