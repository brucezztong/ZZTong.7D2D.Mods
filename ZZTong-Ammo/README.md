If you're playing a game with no traders then the Silver and Gold Nuggets have
no use. This modlet lets you convert them into Brass.

- 1 Gold Nugget can be changed into 2000 Brass in a Chemistry Station.
- 1 Silver Nugget can be changed into 1000 Brass in a Chemistry Station.

This modlet also adds recipes for alternative forms of bullet casings made
from plastic and iron.

- 6 Iron and 1 Clay can be crafted into 1 Bullet Casing in a Forge.
- 6 Polymers and 1 Scrap Iron can be crafted into 1 Bullet Casing in a Chemistry Station.

Note: In real life people have made bullet casings from iron and plastic. They
were not generally economical and/or reliable. My motiviation for this modlet was if
I play with no traders, I cannot earn very many Dukes to melt down into casings.
