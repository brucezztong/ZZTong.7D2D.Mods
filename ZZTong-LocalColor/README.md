# ZZTong-LocalColor

This adds a number of notes and advertisements to loot that refer to local events and stores.
It can make the world seem like there used to be people living there. It assumes locations
from the ZZTong-Prefabs modlet are included in the game, but the modlet will work without
any dependency. The notes and advertisements are added to these Vanilla loot groups:

- groupBackpacks01
- groupPurse01
- groupJunk01
- groupMailboxes01

So, if you're playing an overhaul, it is possible this modlet will fail as some overhauls
will completely redesign and rename all of the Vanilla lootgroups.
