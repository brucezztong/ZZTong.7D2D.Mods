# ZZTong-Frames

The goal of this modlet is to discourage players jumping onto hastily placed
frames as a form of defense. I completely respect players building something.
I'm just not a fan of a stack of plywood boxes being an instant defense.
This lets the zombies push over these houses of cards.

In a perverse way, it also makes defending your construction project a thing.
