# ZZTong-DevTools

This holds some quality of life changes for POI development. It does not
affect game play. Specifically:

- Exposes the Vanilla cntBuriedFoodStashChest to the Prefab Editor's blocks menu.
- Exposes the Vanilla cntBuriedWeaponChest to the Prefab Editor's blocks menu.
- Exposes the Vanilla cntBuriedLootStashChest to the Prefab Editor's blocks menu.
- Exposes the Vanilla cntBuriedLootStashChestInsecure to the Prefab Editor's blocks menu.

- Defines a "zzSuperBrush" which is really Pille's Super Brush (for painting) but named so that
the modlet will not collide with other sources of Pille's Super Brush. Thanks Pille!
