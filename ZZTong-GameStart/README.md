# ZZTong-GameStart

This modlet just lets me start with everything I need to harvest for the starter goals.
Specifically, each player starts with:

- A note from the Duke
- 35 Plant Fibers
- 36 Wood
- 10 Small Rocks
- 1 Feather

You might find this handy for server play as new players sometimes spawn into places
that have already been stripped of natural resources.
