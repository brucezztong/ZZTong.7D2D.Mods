# ZZTong-Vehicles

Changes the amount of hitpoints vehicles have. Vanilla vehicles are sometimes too fragile
but other vehicle modlets make them too durable for my tastes. This modlet triples the
DegredationMax value. This is kind of a tradeoff because vehicles suffer a wide range of
damage. Yes, in Vanilla, you can drive the motorcycle off the tallest skyscraper, survive,
and drive away and at the same time hit a shopping cart at full speed and lose 25% of the
vehicle's health.

- Bicycle health from 1,500 to 4,500.
- Minibike health from 2,000 to 6,000.
- Motorcycle health from 4,000 to 12,000.
